## UX Planes

### Strategy Plane

- Business Goals:  


- Audience: 

- Content: 

#### Personal Goals

- 

### Scope Plane

- 


### Structure Plane

- The site uses a consistent structure, a navbar is at the top of the page which allow a user to navigate the site and login if needed. A burger menu is used for small devices.
- The index page has a search bar, filter and sort feature.
- The content is consistant with text kept to a minimum.
- A footer at the bottom provides copyright information and links to social media pages. 
- The number of clicks needed to reach any page is kept to a minimum. Sections such as user profiles will not be visible to users who are not logged in.
- Buttons/modals/links are consistant in design.

### Skeleton Plane
#### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq and figma to create the wireframes.

### Surface Plane

- The number is fonts is kept at a minimum as well as using a limited and consistant color scheme.

#### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Color Scheme

Colors are kept to a minimum in order to keep focus on the imagery of the recipes, chosen colours are various shades of grey. Color scheme can be found on my Coolors profile: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/u/sean_mcmahon)

#### Typography

2 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:

- [Pattaya](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pattaya?query=patt) : Logo & Headings, used for it's flowing relaxed style.
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse) : Body, used for it's excellent readability.

#### Media

All images are the authors own unless. Logos are also produced by the author using Affinity Design.

# Testing
All testing and validation is contained within a separate .md file. <br> [View TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

# Deployment

1. This repository may be cloned directly into an editor by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/Sean-Mc-Mahon/inner-purr`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button "Clone or download" , then "Download Zip" button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.
2. In the terminal window change directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).
3. Set up environment variables:
    - Create **.env** file in the root directory.
    - On the top of the file add `import os` to set the environment variables in the operating system.
    - Set the connection to your MongoDB database(MONGO_URI) and a SECRET_KEY with the following syntax:
    `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YourSecretKey"`   
    `os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YourMongoURI"`  
    .
4. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:   
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
*Note: GitPod does not require `sudo`, so if you use another IDE, you will need to include `sudo` in the beginning of the command: `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.*

7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command `python3 run.py`. 

### Heroku Deployment
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:  
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:   
`echo web: python run.py > Procfile`
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository
4. Create a **new app** in Heroku, assigning a name (must be unique) and set a region (for my project I set Europe)
5. From the Heroku dashboard link the new Heroku app to your GitHub repository:    
    - "Deploy" -> "Deployment method" -> "GitHub"
    - then "Enable automatic deployment"
6. To start the web process, put the following command into the terminal: `heroku ps:scale web=1` to scale dynos
7. In the **Settings** tab of the new Heroku app, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and set the following config vars:
    - **IP** : 0.0.0.0
    - **PORT** : 8080
    - **MONGO_URI** : `<link to your MongoDB database>`
    - **SECRET_KEY** : `<your secret key>`
    - **DEBUG**: **FALSE**  
*Note: your MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY must match the ones you entered in .env.py file*

8. The app will be deployed and ready to run. Click "Open App" to view the app.   

**Note**: if you have not linked GitHub and Heroku following step **5**, alternatively as the last step of deployment, you can put the following command into your terminal:   
 `heroku login`, after a successful log in `git push heroku master` - to push the app to Heroku, and finally click "Open App" in Heroku dashboard to view the app.
